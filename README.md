## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the work completed by **Team Aditya** as part of the Market Segmentation study project. The primary objectives of this project are to understand the fundamentals of market segmentation, replicate a case study in Python, and prepare for segmentation analysis of an assigned market domain.

## **Project Structure**

### **1. Fundamentals of Market Segmentation**
- Definition: Dividing a broad market into sub-groups based on shared characteristics.
- Benefits:
  - Tailored marketing strategies
  - Improved resource allocation
  - Enhanced customer satisfaction
- Overview of the 10 Steps of Market Segmentation:
  - Deciding (not) to segment
  - Specifying the ideal target segment
  - Collecting data
  - Exploring data
  - Extracting segments
  - Profiling segments
  - Describing segments
  - Selecting target segments
  - Customizing the marketing mix
  - Evaluation and monitoring (excluded in this phase)

### **2. Case Study: Replication in Python**
- **Objective:** Recreate a McDonaldâ€™s segmentation case study to understand real-world applications of market segmentation.
- **Steps:**
  - Data exploration and cleaning
  - Implementing clustering (e.g., k-means)
  - Visualizing segment characteristics
- **Tools Used:**
  - Python (pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
  - Jupyter Notebook

## **Key Learnings**

- Importance of data preparation in segmentation
- Application of clustering techniques for real-world data
- Collaboration and coordination in team-based projects

---

## **Next Steps**

- Segmentation analysis of the assigned market domain
- Application of learnings to refine segmentation strategies
- Continuous evaluation of segment effectiveness
